My configs for my daily workflow. Tested to work on Arch linux... other
flavors may vary!

## To install
Simply run `sh repo_to_local.sh` and let the magic happen! However, know that
this **will overwrite** your current config, so make a backup, or reap the 
consequences!

## Included configs
* vimrc
* bashrc
* i3
* xbindkeys
* xinitrc
* termite
* qutebrowser

## TODO::
* Create a pacman package list so that I can setup a new computer with one
command
* Create a packer package list so that I can setup a new computer with one
command
* Create an `install_all_packages.sh`
